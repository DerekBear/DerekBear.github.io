Allen Memorial Library was named after Carlos Eben Allen, the 3rd president of Valley City State University, and opened its doors in 1951. It presently houses more than 100,000 books, periodicals, microforms, and nonprint materials, and maintains a robust digital collection. The collection’s strengths reflect the curricular strengths of the university: education, business, information science, the arts, as well as general science, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences.
