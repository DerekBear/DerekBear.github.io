                <p>The W.E. Osmon Fieldhouse is the main gymnasium on the campus of Valley City State University. Affectionately known as "The Bubble" by locals, the Osmon Fieldhouse is home to the Viking men's and women's basketball teams.

                    With a capacity of about 2200 people, The Bubble creates an exceptional atmosphere during big games.
                    
                    The Fieldhouse is also used as the location for VCSU's annual Commencement Ceremony, and is the site of the annual Boys and Girls Barnes County Basketball Tournaments. Volleyball, football, baseball and softball also use the fieldhouse as a practice facility at certain times during the year.
