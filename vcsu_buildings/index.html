                <p>In my last column, I wrote about the “ghost buildings” on the VCSU campus. I hope you remembered a few of them! Each of those buildings was known by its function or location (Old Science, West Hall, Park Ave. Cottage). But now all the buildings on campus are known by people’s last names. I am curious (and I hope you are too!) about what’s behind a building’s name, and in the next few columns I plan to look at a few of those named buildings and the people they were named after at VCSU. Many of the details in this column come from “Cornerstones,” the VCSU centennial history by Dr. Welch.

We have dedicated, experienced faculty who involve students in field work and research, providing undergraduates with the type of hands-on experience typically found in graduate programs. Classes are held in our Rhoades Science Center with safe and modern labs, a greenhouse, and North Dakota’s only planetarium.

                <p>Snoeyenbos Hall is a suite-style residence hall that opened in the fall of 2011 after a year's worth of renovations. The first floor of this residence hall is home to two large lounges with flat-screen televisions. A pool table is located in one of the lounges while the other lounge has dining seating and is located next to the kitchen. As residents travel the halls of the first floor, they will also find a fitness room, laundry facilities, as well as recycling areas. The upper floors of Snoeyenbos Hall can be reached by one of the two stairwells or the elevator. Each upper floor has laundry facilities, a study lounge, a TV lounge, recycling rooms, laundry rooms, and a kitchenette. These suites accommodate five residents, who share private bathroom facilities, in the two double rooms and one single room.
