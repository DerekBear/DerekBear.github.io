Study wild wolves in Yellowstone, sample waters in local rivers and lakes, or conduct research on fruit flies as part of your science education at VCSU. We have dedicated, experienced faculty who involve students in field work and research, providing undergraduates with the type of hands-on experience typically found in graduate programs. Classes are held in our Rhoades Science Center with safe and modern labs, a greenhouse, and North Dakotaâ€™s only planetarium. Specialized internship opportunities are available to help you jump start your career or prepare you for graduate school.
